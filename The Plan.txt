Give animationsetup a list of animations
It takes each of those animations and stores them in a gfc_list

In the future properly redo cylinder collisions and use that for player instead:
If a cylinder collides with a triangle, then add that triangle's normal*overlap to the entity with the cylinder's position
ONLY CHECK IF A TRIANGLE'S VERTICAL ANGLE IS WITHIN SOME RANGE

House:
Figure out how to make the door push the character (Check if detected, and if so, use the actor's velocity as 1 pointed towards the object if velocity is 0?)
uv map that thing
Has positions for ammo/health pickup
Has position for powerup
Has position for door

Door:
Have the door check if it is colliding with any character3d. If so, push the character3d half the distance away

One functioning enemy

Idea:
When enemy is spawned, gets given a point on the map where it walks around a certain radius. When the player is a certain distance from it,
the enemy will approach the player. If the player is too far, the enemy will make their current point the new epicenter for wandering around.
