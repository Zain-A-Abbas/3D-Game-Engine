One functioning enemy

Idea:
When enemy is spawned, gets given a point on the map where it walks around a certain radius. When the player is a certain distance from it,
the enemy will approach the player. If the player is too far, the enemy will make their current point the new epicenter for wandering around.

DONE:
Transfer some stuff from the player to Character3D

One functioning gun UI
- UI object has a "drawUI" function
- "drawUI" checks if the player data is valid, and if so, runs the "drawPlayerUI" function
- "drawPlayerUI" draws the sprites associated with the current weapon as well as remaining ammo in the bottom left (shoot for basic grey circle, text, and 1 png of pistol)
