A fork of gf3d created for learning the process of 3D game engines. This fork largely focused on physics, collision, and camera work, creating a third-person shooter alongside it.

Features:
 * Capsule collisions for characters that can interact with and push against environments
 * A statemachine that can be re-used and refitted for different entities
 * A quadtree for simplifying collision calculations

Some other things are present, but not listed due to being a given for the sort of game created (3D following camera systems, a simple content creation pipeline, etc.)
